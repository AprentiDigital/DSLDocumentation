## Getting Started

*Getting to World said Hello*

The Possum Labs DSL library to add integration tests for an existing system. This section helps you get to the point where you can run tests and set up your project. 

First, we will focus on setting up the environment. The chances are that your system already has some of the steps completed. Once your environment is ready, we will guide you through setting up your first project.

We will use a simple [testing website](http://possumlabs.com/testsite/) to help walk through the process of setting up a project. At the end of the guide, you will have your first few tests. More importantly, we will show you how to expand your domain-specific language. 

There are detailed tutorials that focus on specific features, later on, to help provide examples on how to grow your language further.
