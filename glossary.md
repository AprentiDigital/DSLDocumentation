### Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

A domain-specific language is a limited-use language made up of words that have meaning within a certain context. That context, or domain, is often a product, business, or workflow. The words in a domain-specific language can be combined and used to accomplish specific tasks. Alexa, Cortana, and Siri are examples of domain-specific languages: you can interact with them in simple, scripted ways to accomplish tasks.

### Git

Git is a free, open source tool for source control management. It is primarily used in software development for tracking changes to source code, and it can be used and managed via the command line or any number of third-party applications that provide graphical user interfaces.

### Mono

[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework that makes it possible to develop cross-platform applications. Supported platforms include Windows, MacOS, Linux, and [others](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/).

### Source Control

Source control, also known as version control, is change management for sets of information like source code and documents. Source control tools like Git allow individuals or groups of people to make and keep track of changes to data and resources, merge and resolve conflicting changes, and reverse or revert changes if needed.

Distributed version control is a kind of source control where everyone working on a project has a complete copy of it mirrored on their own computer as well as a complete history of its changes.

### SpecFlow

[SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) is a testing framework that supports a domain-specific language called Gherkin. SpecFlow integrates with Visual Studio and provides testing solutions for .NET platforms, including the .NET Desktop Framework, .NET Core, and Mono. It is an open source port of Cucumber.

### Test-Driven Development

### Ubiquitous language

### Variable

### Visual Studio

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is a full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It can be used to develop and debug software, apps, and websites. The [Visual Studio Community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) is free, while the Professional and Enterprise editions are subscription-based. Visual Studio is primarily available for Windows. There is also a version available for MacOS, but can only be used with .NET Core.

### Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode for short) is a free, cross-platform text editor for managing source code. It includes developer tools and optional extensions that help with language support, testing, and debugging, and that make it a viable alternative to Visual Studio for many projects. It is available for Windows, MacOS, and some Linux distributions.
